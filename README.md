# Customer Segmentation

## Overview

Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This project focuses on utilizing clustering algorithms to segment customers for better understanding and personalized marketing strategies.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to segment customers using unsupervised learning, specifically K-Means clustering, to gain insights into customer behavior based on the provided data. The segments created will help businesses to target each group with tailored marketing campaigns and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Features

- Customer data analysis and visualization.
- Application of K-Means clustering to segment customers.
- Evaluation of the clustering results using various metrics.
- Visualization of the clusters for better interpretation.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For applying K-Means clustering algorithm.
  
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various customer attributes like:
- Age
- Income
- Spending Score
- Gender

The dataset should be cleaned and pre-processed to ensure better performance of the clustering algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samratnitesh/Customer_Segmentation.git
   cd Customer_Segmentation
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to analyze and segment customers.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and normalized to prepare it for clustering.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means is applied to the pre-processed data to create clusters.
3. **Visualization**: The clusters are visualized to interpret the segments formed.

## Results

The clusters formed through K-Means clustering will represent distinct customer segments. For example:
- **Cluster 1**: High spenders with moderate income.
- **Cluster 2**: Young customers with low income and low spending.
- **Cluster 3**: Older customers with high income and spending capacity.

These segments can be used by businesses to better understand customer needs and target marketing efforts effectively.

## Future Enhancements

- Experimenting with different clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
- Including more customer attributes for better segmentation accuracy.
- Integrating customer segmentation results into a recommendation system for product suggestions.
